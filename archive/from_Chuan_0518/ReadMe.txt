- String names for the codes used in the data example: dict_combine_uniform_molei.Rdata
“feature_id” is the column name that used in the data

- Link to the GitHub repo for efficient calculation of cooccurrence and embeddings:
The final version of cooccurrence codes were created and published by our VA collaborator at the ORNL gitlab (I asked Tianxi and she suggested that we should use this version):
https://code.ornl.gov/mvp-champion/research-support/cooccurrence-matrix

- Code to create word clouds from the output
Code: Word.Cloud.R
Example data: feature.select.res.Rdata (this is an example feature selection result using Molei’s code, and then attaching the string description)

- Screenshot of network and link to interactive visualization
Tianxi suggested me to fix one issue of the network. I will send you later, or you may grant me access to the github and I can upload the screenshot directly when it is ready.
